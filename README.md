# Computer Graphics - Assignment 1
## 3D Scene Editor in WebGL

### Overview
This project is a 3D Scene Editor built using WebGL in JavaScript for my Computer Graphics course in the Federal University of Pelotas. This editor allows you to select different 3D models and create a scene, by translating, rotating, scaling and changing texture properties in the editor. You can also save and load your own scenes (textures images not included).

The 3D models in the editor were made by **Kay Lousberg** in the "Mini-Game Variety Pack" I got on (itch.io)[https://kaylousberg.itch.io/kay-kit-mini-game-variety-pack]. All credits to him for the models.

### Features
- **Object Creation**: Add various 3D shapes from the Mini-Game Variety Pack.
- **Transformations**: Translate, rotate, scale and change texture color and add your own texture image.
- **Camera Control**: Navigate in the scene using PlayStation 2 controls!
- **Save/Load Scenes**: Save your created scenes in JSON format and load them back into the editor.

### Usage
- Use the "Create Model" tab in the right menu to select and add the models in the center of the scene.
- Use the "Model Selector" menu in the left menu to select the objects in the scene to change their properties.
- Use the "Model Properties" tab in the right menu to manipulate the object transformation and texture.
- Click the "LOAD SCENE" button to save your scene in JSON format.
- Click the "LOAD SCENE" button to load a previously saved scene.

### Technologies Used
- **WebGL**: For rendering 3D graphics.
- **JavaScript**: For application logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the user interface.
